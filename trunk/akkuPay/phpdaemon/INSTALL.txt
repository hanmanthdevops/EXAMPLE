1) Compile and install the daemon program to /usr/bin using the following command (first install gcc-c++ if not already installed)
g++ phpdaemon.cpp -o /usr/bin/phpdaemon

2)Create symlinks to the main /usr/bin/phpdaemon binary for each init.d process that you need
ln -s  /usr/bin/phpdaemon /usr/bin/apBatches

3) Copy the init script(s) under init_scripts folder to /etc/init.d and change the permissions (see #4 below for filenames)
cp apBatches /etc/init.d/
chmod 777 /etc/init.d/apBatches
chkconfig apBatches on

4) edit /etc/init.d/phpdaemon and set the values for $phpscript and $sleep
$phpscriptpath is the full path to the php script file
$phpscript is the filename of the php script
$sleep is the delay between successive executions of the script
